[url=https://github.com/emoryoakley/SmallerGeothermalGenerator/blob/master/README.zh.md]繁體中文說明[/url] | [url=https://github.com/emoryoakley/SmallerGeothermalGenerator/blob/master/README.md]English README[/url]
[b]Introduction:[/b] This RimWorld mod introduces four new sizes for the vanilla geothermal generator: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.
To enhance gameplay realism and provide customization options, the values for power output and resources required for construction are adjustable via the in-game settings menu. All other attributes, such as maximum hit points, work required to build, and necessary construction skill levels, are preset and consistent with the default values.

[b]How to Use:[/b]
1. Subscribe to or download this mod, and enable it in-game.
2. Complete the "Geothermal Power" research to unlock the new generator sizes.
3. Modify power output and resources required to suit your preferences through the mod settings menu.

[b]Compatibility and Notes:[/b]
- This mod is incompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885]Geothermal Power Extenders[/url].
    - You can still enable both this mod and the Geothermal Power Extenders mod in the game at the same time.
    - But the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885]Geothermal Power Extenders[/url] mod adds an extension building, which requires placement next to a geothermal generator. However, this extension building cannot be placed next to the four new geothermal generators added by this mod.
