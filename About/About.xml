[h3][b]Introduction:[/b][/h3]
This is a simple RimWorld mod that adjusts the size of the original geothermal generator and introduces four new sizes: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.
To make it more realistic, the mod includes adjusted values for the four new geothermal generators, such as [b]max power output[/b], [b]resources to make[/b], [b]max hit points[/b], [b]work to make[/b], and [b]required construction skill levels[/b].
Aside from the listed values, theoretically, other building attributes or features remain consistent with the original geothermal generator.

You can also modify the [b]max power output[/b] and [b]resources to make[/b] in the mod settings.

[h3][b]Compatibility and Notes:[/b][/h3]
[list]
[*] This mod is incompatible with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885]Geothermal Power Extenders[/url].
    [list]
    [*] You can still enable both this mod and the Geothermal Power Extenders mod in the game at the same time.
    [*] But the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3373466885]Geothermal Power Extenders[/url] mod adds an extension building, which requires placement next to a geothermal generator. However, this extension building cannot be placed next to the four new geothermal generators added by this mod.
